### While doing this portion of the term project I learend how to create sitemaps and wireframes as well as the productivity that they bring to a large project like this one.
### For this part of the project my partner and I went through what we wanted on the sitemap and wireframes and once we formulated an idea i created the sitemap while my partner created the wireframe. after both were created we each looked over the others work to look for mistakes and fix anything we were unhappy with

### This portion of the project taught me how to create a sitemap and then design a wireframe based on that. I also learned how these two elements are helpful when deciding on the content, flow, and layout of a project like this. 
### My partner and I went through and discussed the project and what it requires, we then worked through the content we wanted to include in the sitemap and the wireframes. He created the sitemap and I created the wireframe - we then looked through eachother's work to edit anything that we didn't like. 
### We created the wireframes for the sign in and signup page, the page to search for classes as well as the results of that search, the homepage for the student's courses as well as the page for the course, and finally we created the wireframe for course page for the instructor.
